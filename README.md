### Description:
https://docs.google.com/document/d/1PuVTBu2CNC6ZLt0P0CWeue1tPP2sP9sweS5I7oEdl7w/edit?usp=sharing
## MVP Core Features
1. Function for choosing which problem a user should do next, based on their scores on previous problems across 15 categories.

2. Timer for logging a userâ€™s practice session on a given day.

## Setup:
* [x] Package.json dependencies. NPM install.
* [x] Webpack setup and folder structure: backend (node / express), frontend (react/redux), database (mongoose)
* [x] Create database on MongoDB.com. Get Mongo_URI link string and place in repo.
* [ ] Design database schema: 
    * [x] server/models/algoModels --> Schema for an algo problem
    * [x] created [wireframes for dashboard & data models](/docs/wireframe_june7.png) using ExCaliber

## Task 1. AlgoModel / Controller / Component
* [ ] Put 5 dummy problems in MongoDB database. 
* [ ] Test GET/POST/PUT/DELETE routes for database in Postman
* [ ] Set up server.js & algoController to GET a problem.
* [ ] Display problem in front end, without Redux.js

* [ ] Multiple steps: Figure out Redux actions / dispatch / reducer for getting a problem...
